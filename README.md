### Strategic Planning Breakdown

This application is for a client who runs a motivation and goal setting consultancy company. During goal setting a number of goals are brainstormed and then written down. Long term goals to short term goals. Then the short goals are associated with long term goals. The difficult part was organizing and visualizing. This application takes all those goals and displays them in a tree view on the website.

At the time of writing this application is bleeding edge with Rails 5.0.1 and Ruby 2.3.1.
